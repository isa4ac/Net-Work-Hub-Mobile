[Mobile Mock-Up](https://www.figma.com/file/HOHliVBL5WbkDO6eI1eWdF/Net-Work-Hub?type=design&node-id=302-27513&mode=design&t=jHwKvEz6PtKUaJKr-0)

  The NetWorkHub app is an innovative solution that provides network engineers with an increase in productivity between jobs and provides businesses with cost-saving opportunities versus hiring bigger companies to work on their infrastructure. 

  The objective in our design is to create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for non-technical users to meet with skilled network engineers that can complete tasks for them, as well as to provide the network engineers an equally intuitive interface to view network information for the business that contract them.  

  Business owners can submit job requests, which are then bid on by applicants using the website. Once a job agreement is reached, the network engineer can have a RaspberryPi device shipped to the local businessâ€™ address with instructions to plug in the pi to their router and to power. The Raspberry Pi then runs scripts to scan the data directly to the website for the network engineer to utilize for the job. Via the website, the Network/Security engineers can also connect to the Raspberry Pi's CLI/GUI via NoVNC.
